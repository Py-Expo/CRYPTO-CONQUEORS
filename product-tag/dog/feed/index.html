										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <b>beagle</b> is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dogfor prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.</p>
<p>Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Pugs' legs are strong, straight, of moderate length, and are set well under.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <b>Pug</b> is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles.</p>
<p>Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart. In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, their toes are well split-up, and their nails are black.<sup id="cite_ref-AKC_Breed_Standard_4-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug#cite_note-AKC_Breed_Standard-4">[4]</a></sup> The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, resulting in an under-bite</p>
